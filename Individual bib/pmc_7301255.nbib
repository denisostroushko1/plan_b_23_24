AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials need efficient tools to assist in recruiting patients 
      at risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Early detection can 
      also assist patients with financial planning for long-term care. Clinical notes 
      are an important, underutilized source of information in machine learning models 
      because of the cost of collection and complexity of analysis. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to investigate the use of deidentified clinical notes from multiple 
      hospital systems collected over 10 years to augment retrospective machine 
      learning models of the risk of developing ADRD. METHODS: We used 2 years of data 
      to predict the future outcome of ADRD onset. Clinical notes are provided in a 
      deidentified format with specific terms and sentiments. Terms in clinical notes 
      are embedded into a 100-dimensional vector space to identify clusters of related 
      terms and abbreviations that differ across hospital systems and individual 
      clinicians. RESULTS: When using clinical notes, the area under the curve (AUC) 
      improved from 0.85 to 0.94, and positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 
      45.07% (25,245/56,018) to 68.32% (14,153/20,717) in the model at disease onset. 
      Models with clinical notes improved in both AUC and PPV in years 3-6 when notes' 
      volume was largest; results are mixed in years 7 and 8 with the smallest cohorts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical notes helped in the short term, the presence of 
      ADRD symptomatic terms years earlier than onset adds evidence to other studies 
      that clinicians undercode diagnoses of ADRD. De-identified clinical notes 
      increase the accuracy of risk models. Clinical notes collected across multiple 
      hospital systems via natural language processing can be merged using 
      postprocessing techniques to aid model accuracy.
