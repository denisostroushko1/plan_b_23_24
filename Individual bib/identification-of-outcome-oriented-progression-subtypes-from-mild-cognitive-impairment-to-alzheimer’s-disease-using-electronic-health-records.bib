	abstract = {Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that requires an in-depth understanding of its progression pathways and contributing factors to develop effective risk stratification and prevention strategies. In this study, we proposed an outcome-oriented model to identify progression pathways from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD using electronic health records (EHRs) from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD. These pathways can serve as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the factors influencing AD progression and to develop personalized interventions to delay or prevent the onset of the disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially supported by a grant from the Ed and Ethel Moore Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Research Program of the Florida Department of Health (FL DOH $\#$23A09) and grants (R01AG080624, R01AG080991, R01AG076234, and UL1TR001427) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study has been approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (protocol no. IRB202202820).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.Yes},
