	abstract = {Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that requires an in-depth understanding of its progression pathways and contributing factors to develop effective risk stratification and prevention strategies. In this study, we proposed an outcome-oriented model to identify progression pathways from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD using electronic health records (EHRs) from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD. These pathways can serve as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the factors influencing AD progression and to develop personalized interventions to delay or prevent the onset of the disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially supported by a grant from the Ed and Ethel Moore Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Research Program of the Florida Department of Health (FL DOH $\#$23A09) and grants (R01AG080624, R01AG080991, R01AG076234, and UL1TR001427) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study has been approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (protocol no.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the use of deidentified clinical notes from multiple hospital systems collected over 10 years to augment retrospective machine learning models of the risk of developing ADRD. METHODS: We used 2 years of data to predict the future outcome of ADRD onset. Clinical notes are provided in a deidentified format with specific terms and sentiments. Terms in clinical notes are embedded into a 100-dimensional vector space to identify clusters of related terms and abbreviations that differ across hospital systems and individual clinicians. RESULTS: When using clinical notes, the area under the curve (AUC) improved from 0.85 to 0.94, and positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 45.07% (25,245/56,018) to 68.32% (14,153/20,717) in the model at disease onset. Models with clinical notes improved in both AUC and PPV in years 3-6 when notes' volume was largest; results are mixed in years 7 and 8 with the smallest cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical notes helped in the short term, the presence of ADRD symptomatic terms years earlier than onset adds evidence to other studies that clinicians undercode diagnoses of ADRD. De-identified clinical notes increase the accuracy of risk models. Clinical notes collected across multiple hospital systems via natural language processing can be merged using postprocessing techniques to aid model accuracy.},

abstract = {Objective
To review the current state of science using big data to advance Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research and practice. In particular, we analyzed the types of research foci addressed, corresponding methods employed and study findings reported using big data in AD.
Method
Systematic review was conducted for articles published in PubMed from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015. Keywords with AD and big data analytics were used for literature retrieval. Articles were reviewed and included if they met the eligibility criteria.
Results
Thirty-eight articles were included in this review. They can be categorized into seven research foci: diagnosing AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=10), predicting MCI to AD conversion (n=13), stratifying risks for AD (n=5), mining the literature for knowledge discovery (n=4), predicting AD progression (n=2), describing clinical care for persons with AD (n=3), and understanding the relationship between cognition and AD (n=3). The most commonly used datasets are AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n=16), electronic health records (EHR) (n=11), MEDLINE (n=3), and other research datasets (n=8). Logistic regression (n=9) and support vector machine (n=8) are the most used methods for data analysis.
Conclusion
Big data are increasingly used to address AD-related research questions. While existing research datasets are frequently used, other datasets such as EHR data provide a unique, yet under-utilized opportunity for advancing AD research.}

abstract = {Objective
We develop a deep learning framework based on the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model using unstructured clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the risk of disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
Methods
We identified 3657 patients diagnosed with MCI together with their progress notes from Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) between 2000 and 2020. The progress notes no later than the first MCI diagnosis were used for the prediction. We first preprocessed the notes by deidentification, cleaning and splitting into sections, and then pre-trained a BERT model for AD (named AD-BERT) based on the publicly available Bio+Clinical BERT on the preprocessed notes. All sections of a patient were embedded into a vector representation by AD-BERT and then combined by global MaxPooling and a fully connected network to compute the probability of MCI-to-AD progression. For validation, we conducted a similar set of experiments on 2563 MCI patients identified at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) during the same timeframe.
Results
Compared with the 7 baseline models, the AD-BERT model achieved the best performance on both datasets, with Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.849 and F1 score of 0.440 on NMEDW dataset, and AUC of 0.883 and F1 score of 0.680 on WCM dataset.
Conclusion
The use of EHRs for AD-related research is promising, and AD-BERT shows superior predictive performance in modeling MCI-to-AD progression prediction. Our study demonstrates the utility of pre-trained language models and clinical notes in predicting MCI-to-AD progression, which could have important implications for improving early detection and intervention for AD.}

Results Only 11\% of dementia patients and 24\% of AD patients had a cognitive measure documented in the 5 years prior to diagnosis. Black race, older age, non-commercial health insurance, lower mean neighborhood income, greater in-patient stays, and fewer out-patient visits were associated with lacking cognitive measures. Discussion Extensive missing cognitive data and differences in the availability of cognitive measures by race, age, and socioeconomic factors hinder patient care and limit utility of EHR for dementia research.

abstract = {Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are a global challenge. Early diagnosis is important to manage the disease. However, there are barriers to diagnosis that differ by region. Researchers from Brazil, China, Nigeria, Spain, and Sweden have identified key barriers to AD diagnosis in their countries. In Brazil, socioeconomic inequalities and poor recognition of dementia by physicians can prevent diagnosis. In China, a very large population and lack of physician training in dementia make diagnosis problematic. In Nigeria, socioeconomic inequalities and cultural stigma can stand in the way of diagnosis. In Spain, patient hesitancy and an overloaded health-care system are barriers to diagnosis. In Sweden, inconsistent use of biomarkers is a prominent barrier to diagnosis of AD. To support diagnosis, more focus is needed on education of patients and physicians, increased use of support services, and improved access to biomarkers to accurately diagnose AD.},
